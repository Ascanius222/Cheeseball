			<ul class="ingredients">
				<li>5 lbs. yellow potatoes</li>
				<li>1 ½ sticks butter</li>
				<li>8 oz. cream cheese</li>

		Directions
		</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Peel and cut potatoes. Boil potatoes for 30-45 minutes. When they’re done, the potatoes should almost fall apart when speared with a fork. </li>
				<li>Drain potatoes in a strainer, and add them back to the pot. Place on low heat and mash potatoes, allowing steam to escape. </li>
				<li>Turn off heat. Add butter, cream cheese, and half-and-half, mashing after each addition. Season to taste. </li>
				<li>To make for later use: place mashed potatoes in a casserole dish with pats of butter on top. Cover in foil. Reheat in oven for 45 minutes at 350&#8457; with foil on. </li>
			</ol>
